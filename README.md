# Project: Snake-Game-Webapp-CMPE-131

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/akumar23/SnakeGame.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/akumar23/SnakeGame)

The web app is live right now at: https://snake-webapp.herokuapp.com/

Doc files can be found in the docs folder, under _build then _html then open index.html. It can only be opened after cloning the repo.

The 12 features include:

Allowing users to register with a unique username, allowing them to login with their registered credentials and allow them to logout from every page.

Once they log in, they get sent to a color picker page that has links to different versions of the snake game with different colors for the body of the snake.

One of the options on the color pickers page lets users play a harder version of the game which places an extra dot on the screen that they have to avoid as they collect food.

When users die in the game, their final score is then saved into a leaderboard and they are automatically redirected to it upon death. The page can also be accessed from every page. From this page they can click on a link to replay the game


Admins can also access an adminpanel by going to https://snake-webapp.herokuapp.com/admin, clicking enter, and entering 'letmein' and then there's a button that'll clear the database of all users in case of emergencies.

We also worked on css to make the site have a uniform design and look clean.
